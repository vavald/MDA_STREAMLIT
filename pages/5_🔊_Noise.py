st.markdown("""The noise data consisted of 3 distinctive sets: 
        noise levels measured every second raw, processed and noise events with a probability per type.
        To make the analysis a bit more coherent and logical, a aggregation range of 10 minutes was decided on.
        This is the time that we expect when residents get aggitated, call the police and the latter arrive on scene.
        Let us now look at some initial data concerning the noise levels, based on the important parameters from the model.""")

st.markdown("""Between months, there is not much difference to detect. 
        However, the months February and March appear to be the loudest ones, 
        in contrast to January and July being the quitest months.
        We like to point out that the average noise level peak values have been used in this graph.""")

        is that Sunday has the lowest median and quartiles, but the highest outliers.

        To do this, please select the month that you want to look into or the day of the week.
        Afterwards, the distribution of cases will be shown, 
        while taking into account the uncertainties during the registration.
        What we recommend is clicking on all the transport types in the legend to get them off the graph,
        as these are things that will be difficult to mitigate (sirens) 
        and often happen during the day (passenger car) and do not bother people too much.
        The location used here is at Naamsestraat 35, 
        because this sensor collected the highest amount of noise events.

        so you will see that January and February are missing from the select box.""")
