   In January and February, both the temperature and the noise levels are high. 
   In March there is a difference in comparison to the first two months of the year:

   This tendecy prevails until June.

    Next up is the scatter plot with the noise level of average cars per day every 10 minutes.
    This plot shows us a comparison between the behaviour of the noise level and the behaviour of the average cars,
    every day of the week at the same time in intervals of 10 minutes.
    The colours represent the noise levels with its corresponding values.

    However, time does influence the noise level.
    
    At 3:00 AM the average amount of cars increases,
    however the noise levels start to change. 
    At this time window, we see on Saturday that the average amount of cars is 0, but the noise level is 67.5. 
    Wednesday, Thursday and Friday have a similar trend and their
    noise levels stay between 64 and 66 dB when the average of cars is 0. 
    Saturday at 4:00 AM, we get a high noise level of 70.1 dB when the average autos is 0.
    Wednesday and Thursday have the same situation with 68 dB and 70 dB respectively, when the average of cars is 0.
             
    Monday to Friday:
    Between 7:00 AM and 7:50 AM, the average of cars increases and in a regular week, the noise levels
    increase too. But this increase is not proportional, again a higher average of cars does not imply higher noise levels.
    After 4:00 PM, the noise level decreases.
    Saturday and Sunday:
    Most of the time, until 7:10 PM, the noise levels were 'significantly' lower than the other days.
   
    However, Friday, Saturday and Sunday at 7:10 PM, we can see that the noise level starts to increase and the 
    average amount of cars driving around is smaller than the afternoon period during the whole week.
    All this can be linked to more weekend-related activities.
