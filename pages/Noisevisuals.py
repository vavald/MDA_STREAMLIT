st.markdown("""The noise data consisted of 3 distinctive sets: 
noise levels measured every second, noise events with a probability per type and ... .
To make the analysis a bit more coherent and logical, a aggregation range of 10 minutes was decided on.
This is the time that we expect when residents get aggitated, call the police and the latter arrive on scene.
Let us now look at some initial data concerning the noise levels.""")
